# Use your webcam as a mouse!
This software is for all the people that are tired of using conventional items such as mice.

If you're scared of those strange objects, say no more and greet the future.

Find an object with a uniform color, clear your throat and prepare yourself.


# How to install
Just clone the repo and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

I recommend using a virtual environment.


# How it works

# Functionalities
Move your cursor by hovering an object in front of your webcam.

Produce a sufficiently high sound to left-click.

Coming next: distinction of left and right clicks through DFT.
